# ESP32_SoccerRobotCode
This project contains ESP32-based code for a tracked (crawler-style) soccer robot, driven by 4 unidirectional DC brushed motors and controlled wirelessly using a PS3 DualShock 3 controller via Bluetooth, through the Ps3Controller.h library.
⚙️ Features:
- Tracked motion system using a mechanical crawler design for improved traction.
- 4 unidirectional motors controlled via A4950 motor drivers.
- Bluetooth control with low-latency response using a PS3 controller and the Ps3Controller.h library.
- Suitable for robotic soccer, terrain robots, or educational robotics.
